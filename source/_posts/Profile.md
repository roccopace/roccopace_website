## Research Interests

My research interests are in urban forest modeling and tree ecophysiology. I study the ecosystem services of urban trees to improve air quality and microclimate. The aim is to find suitable nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change and air pollution effects improving the environmental sustainability of cities.
